# PDF-Binarization

Nowadays, many people don't have scanners at home. Therefore they use their cameras to create a PDF Image.

However, if these PDF images were to be printed, it will use a lot of ink due to a background that is not bright.

This project uses edge detection and thresholding techniques to binarize the the image, getting rid of background while leaving the features (handwritten)
